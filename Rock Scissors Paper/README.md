# Rock Scissors Paper

The implementation should be written in object-oriented Python.
It should include some half-smart players and an text based interface to test them.

Mentioned players should include:
 - Random: a player who always choose a random action
 - Serial: a player who choose rock, scissors or paper in serial
 - Most Common: a player who make their choice based on the most used action of their opponent
 - Historian: a player who looks at the previous actions of their opponent and choose their own action based on
what their opponent usually playes after the recently choosen actions. This player has a given memory value which state
how many recent actions the historian will look for in their opponents action-history.
